<h3>Suggested Process</h3>
<ol type="I">
<li>Step 1: Establish a question that you are interested in engaging.  This may be a social, political, educational, journalistic or entirely fictional/creative topic of investigation.
</li>
<li>
Step 2: Address this question by developing a process of production that addresses the question.  The process doesn't necessarily need to arrive at an answer, but it should establish a new perspective.
<ol type="A">
<li>Research the question.  What has your question meant to other people, how have they addressed it?  Establish an informed background for your question.  Archive your research, it may be a research to share with others.  The archive may consist of text, links, images and keep a list of your sources.
</li>
<li>
In your general physical environment, does the element you are questioning exist?  If so, in what form and why?  Do people interact with the question/subject at hand?  Use photography or audio or video to document the objects/manifestations of the question at hand.  All this may help inform and give nuance to your interactive environment.
</li>
<li>
How do people generally interact with the problem and if people do not, how could you create a means of interaction?
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
Begin Production:  Write a brief statement of goals for your project.  Narrow your form of presentation.  What are the most important elements in your virtual environment?  What type of interaction will enrich your goals and give greater meaning to the environment for the user?
</li>
<li>
Post Production: Build your project as web accessible format and upload to itch.io or other similar platform.  One of the advantages of Unity is that you can build a project for multiple paltforms.  VR is immersive and fun, but does it reach the audience that you target?
</li>
<li>
Web Presentation/Distribution:  Establish a title. Primary graphics - is an icon/branding appropriate?  Choose a decorative font that is descriptive of your content.  Establish a color scheme for your site.  Organize your content into logical groupings:
<ul>
<li>About - a brief statement describing your project.</li>
<li>Primary content - characters, animations, environment(s), photographs, audio recordings, videoâ€¦</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
