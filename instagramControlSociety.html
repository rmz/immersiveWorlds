        Milton Friedman taught economic theory at the University of Chicago from 1946 to 1977, where he helped establish the dominance of Neoliberalism or free-market capitalism consisting of privatization, deregulation, cuts to social programs, globalization and a reduction of government in social services.  In 1962, Friedman published <u>Capitalism and Freedom</u> a hugely influential book that promotes the stance that government should involve itself in matters that are absolutely necessary for the survival of its people.  The book pushed against Keynesian economics that advocates for government and central bank intervention during recessions and depressions. (John Maynard Keynes 1936 book, <u>The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</u>)

        The assigned essay draws from Michel Foucault's series of lectures titled "The Birth of Biopolitics" in which Foucault discusses the rise of social and political power over life.  Accoding to Foucault, in the contemporary nation state, individuals are merely monetary agents, we exist as transactional beings that are valued by their capital and purchasing power...  Biopolitics is a form of control over a population as a whole.  The essay applies these ideas to the design and usage of Instagram.

        Extending upon Guy Standing's 2011 <u>The Precariat: The New Dangerous Class</u>, Silvio Lorusso in his book <a href="https://silviolorusso.com/work/entreprecariat-eng/" target="_blank">Entreprecariat</a> describes the unholy connection between entrepreneurship and the precariat as "a worldview, an interpretation of reality that orients behaviour" which combines "exploitation and liberation" and thus can be ultimately understood as "an exploitation of liberation".  He writes: </p>
        <blockquote>The pressure of the entreprecariat does not just demand the constant upgrade of traditional professional skills, but it invades the realm of character, making good humour, optimism and cordiality a competitive advantage to cultivate through meditative practices and behavioural psychology in the form of mobile apps.
