        ❑ A computer is a machine that stores information in a database and a collection of software to manipulate and move that information around.
❑ The Internet is a network of computers (and their databases).
❑ In 1991 the Web gave us a way to access the information on the network of computer databases around the world.
❑ In the early 2000s peer to peer technologies enabled file sharing on a global scale.  (Such as BitTorrent.)
❑ 1999 ubiquitous computing and mobile technologies allowed computers to ‘live among us in the world’.
❑ In 2008 the Bitcoin digital currency was launched – a secure, anonymous and transparent, way to record all transactions to a decentralized global database.
❑ In 2013 people realized that Bitcoin is underpinned by the blockchain protocol that can be used to distribute and enact smart contracts (and smart contracts are pieces of software that can manipulate and move around information, and now digital assets).

        <p>
          A blockchain is a database. It isn't a particularly sophisticated one, either - you could create it in a spreadsheet with minimal effort.
        </p>
        <p>
There are some peculiarities with these databases. The first is that blockchains are append-only. That means that you can only add information - you can't just click on a cell and delete stuff that you've already added, or change it in any way.</p>
<p>
The second is that each entry (called a block) in the database is cryptographically linked to the last entry. In plain English, each new entry must contain a sort of digital fingerprint (hash) of the last one.
And that's it! Since each fingerprint points back to the last one, you end up with a chain of blocks. Or - as the cool kids like to call it - a blockchain.</p>
<p>
A blockchain is immutable: if you change a block, it changes the fingerprint. And since that fingerprint is included in the next block, the next block is changed too. And since that block's fingerprint... well, you get the idea. You end up with a domino effect where any change becomes evident. You can't alter any information without everyone noticing.</p>
<p>
The innovation is that everyone can download blocks from other people on the network to build identical copies of the blockchain on their computers.

      <p>But it is also darkly poetic that another energy-ravenous financial technology should emerge just as we watch the tipping point of manmade global-warming recede to the distant horizon in our rear-view mirrors. So this is not a marketing campaign, but a discussion of ‘what is’. In spite of the, as yet, unresolved technical obstacles of scalability and environmental cost blockchain technologies are here to stay. They are overtaking the WWW as the next big network technology for speculation and disruption. Investors recognize their potential for authentication of identity and matter, more efficient and secure financial transactions and distribution of digital assets; communications so secure as to facilitate voting; and as a coordinating technology for the billions of devices connected to the Internet. They currently attract huge investment from finance, technology and government sectors in anticipation of the fourth industrial revolution of decentralized, super-automation and hyperconnectivity.
      </p>
      <p>
Powerful technologies develop to reflect the interests and values of those who develop them, but impact the everyday lives of us all.</p>

      <p>The name cryptocurrency is a combination of cryptography and currency. With cryptography, we use advanced math to secure our funds, making sure that nobody else can spend them.</p>
      <p>
A cryptocurrency is like a digital form of cash used to buy things, lend money, send money across the globe because it's digital.  But it's different from say PayPal. Traditional online payment gateways are owned by organizations. They hold your money for you, and you need to ask them to transfer it on your behalf when you want to spend it.
</p>
<p>
In cryptocurrencies, there isn't an organization. You, your friends, and thousands of others can act as your own banks by running free software. Your computer connects with other people's computers, meaning you communicate directly – no middlemen required!
</p>
<p>
To use cryptocurrency, you don't need to sign up for a website with an email address and password. You can download a wide variety of apps onto your smartphone to begin sending and receiving within minutes.</p>
