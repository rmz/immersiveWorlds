      <p>...It was Daedalus who built King Minos of Crete a labyrinth to contain the deadly Minotaur... The adventure maze embodies a classic fairy-tale narrative of danger and salvation. Its lasting appeal as both a story and a game pattern derives from the melding of a cognitive problem (finding the path) with an emotionally symbolic pattern (facing what is frightening and unknown). The maze story celebrates the combination of intelligence and courage, and it depicts romantic love as the element that provides the hope that brings the hero into the confrontation and back out again to safety. Like all fairy tales, the maze adventure is a story about survival. The maze is a road map for telling this story. pg.126 <u>Hamlet on the Holodeck</u>

      <!--
      In Greek mythology, Daedalus was a skillful architect and craftsman, seen as a symbol of wisdom, knowledge and power. He is the father of Icarus. Among his most famous creations was the Labyrinth for King Minos of Crete which imprisoned the Minotaur, and the wings that he and his son Icarus used to escape Crete. It was during this escape that Icarus did not heed his father's warnings and flew too close to the sun; the wax holding his wings together melted and Icarus fell to his death.

        <li>I encounter a confusing world and figure it out.</li>
        <li>I encounter a world in pieces and assemble it into a coherent whole.</li>
        <li>I take a risk and am rewarded for my courage.</li>
        <li>I encounter a difficult antagonist and triumph over him.</li>
        <li>I encounter a challenging test of skill or strategy and succeed at it.</li>
        <li>I start off with very little of a valuable commodity and end up with a lot of it (or I start off with a great deal of a burdensome commodity and get rid of all of it).</li>
        <li>I am challenged by a world of constant unpredictable emergencies, and I survive it.</li>

      <p>Today, the success of games such as Minecraft or Fortnite is giving the players the ability to world build, break it apart and re-build...  In Ashes of Creation players can contribute to building towns to cities.</p>

      <h1><u>Hamlet on the Holodeck</u>, Agency</h1>
      <p>...Tetris, the wildly popular and powerfully absorbing computer game of the early 1990s, has clear dramatic content. In Tetris irregularly shaped objects keep falling from the top of the screen and accumulating at the bottom. The player’s goal is to guide each individual piece as it falls and position it so that it will fit together with other pieces and form a uniform row. Every time a complete row forms, it disappears... Success means just being able to keep up with the flow. This game is a perfect enactment of the overtasked lives of Americans in the 1990s—of the constant bombardment of tasks that demand our attention and that we must somehow fit into our overcrowded schedules and clear off our desks in order to make room for the next onslaught.

      <p><a href="https://carne-y-arena.com/" target="_blank">Carne Y Arena</a>, 2017 by Alejandro G. Iñárritu - Based on true accounts, the superficial lines between subject and bystander are blurred and bound together, allowing individuals to walk in a vast space and thoroughly live a fragment of the refugees's personal journeys. An immersive installation that reunites frequent collaborators Iñárritu and Emmanuel Lubezki alongside producer Mary Parent and ILMxLAB, CARNE y ARENA is a twenty-minute solo journey centered around a virtual reality sequence experienced by three concurrent visitors in separate rooms that employs state-of-the-art immersive technology to create a multi-narrative light space with human characters.

      <a href="https://youtu.be/zHT016FbR30" target="_blank">Chalkroom</a>, 2017 by Laurie Anderson in collaboration with Hsin-Chien Huang. In ‘Chalkroom’ it is possible to float around virtually and to explore a hand-drawn universe of sentences and words written in chalk on the walls, guided all the while by Laurie Anderson’s voice – stories and storytelling are at the heart of the work.

      <p><a href="https://www.paisleysmith.com/homestay" target="_blank">Homestay</a>, 2018 by Paisley SmithEvery - Every year thousands of international students come to Canada to study. Many of them pay rent and live with host families across the country to ensure they make the most of their Canadian experience.  This is one family’s story of  loss and suicide, and learning to make sense of grief.

      <p><a href="https://www.onx.studio/secret-garden" target="_blank">Secret Garden</a>, 2020 by Stephanie Dinkins - Step into a garden and encounter oral histories spanning generations of Black women. As you wander this spatialized floral estate, you will encounter African-American women with stories to tell: surviving a slave boat, growing up on a 1920s Black-owned farm, surviving 9/11, and an AI powered by Black women. Secret Garden reminds us that sharing and receiving stories is an act of resistance.

      <p><a href="https://networked-ecosystem.itch.io/networked-ecosystem" target="_blank">Networked Ecosystem</a>, 2021 by Mark Ramos and Ziyang Wu is a live-simulation environment that presents an ecosystem built of a variety of digital senses. Commissioned by NEW INC, Rhizome and Nokia Bell Labs, Networked Ecosystem takes machine vision and sensing data collected by Bell Lab’s experimental robots and sensors and repurposes it to drive a 3D environmental simulation.</p>
      <p>In Networked Ecosystem, natural phenomena have been replaced by digital and artificial systems as forces that drive development: Electricity/battery = sustenance, WIFI signals = nutrition, Lidar data = fire/heat. Data Organisms populate this digital ecosystem as native life forms in the form of bots, AI’s, and avatars. Visitors to this networked landscape develop new kinds of digital senses to experience data as environmental changes, and interact with the simulated world and each other in an ever-changing online environment.

      <p><i>Tomb of the Unknown Marxist</i> by Anna Ozbek tracks a journey of uncovering an individual’s past as a leftist revolutionary in late 1970s Turkey. In doing so, the project explores the political movements of that turbulent period and asks what remains of the revolution in the revolutionary once these moments are well in the past.
