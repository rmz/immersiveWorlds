      <h1>Final Quotes &amp; Comments - <u>Hamlet on the Holodeck</u></h1>
      <p>The violent gaming culture that now characterizes much of cyberspace is likely to spread as the Internet gains speed and bandwidth. Teams of combatants from every corner of the globe will blast each other’s avatars with ever more macho digital weapons; the narrative formulas of combat tied to disturbingly lurid images will continue to proliferate. At the same time, the communal aspects of cyberspace are also growing rapidly, with people eager to construct utopian fantasy worlds that they can share with one another. The Internet is therefore likely to serve as a global stage for conflicts between these two groups, turning the struggle between the blasters and the builders into a kind of worldwide morality play...</p>
      <p>...The computer is chameleonic. It can be seen as a theater, a town hall, an unraveling book, an animated wonderland, a sports arena, and even a potential life form. But it is first and foremost a representational medium, a means for modeling the world that adds its own potent properties to the traditional media it has assimilated so quickly. As the most powerful representational medium yet invented, it should be put to the highest tasks of society. Whether or not we will one day be rewarded with the arrival of the cyberbard, we should hasten to place this new compositional tool as firmly as possible in the hands of the storytellers.  pg. 262

      <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
      <p>Janet Murray has pointed to ELIZA, "an early natural language processing computer program created from 1964 to 1966 at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Joseph Weizenbaum" (pg.70) as an effective trick due to ingenious programming and writing.  People felt as if they were indeed speaking with a therapist, not a bot.  Today, the experiments in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, machine learning have been fully commercialized to track both the virtual and physical world, largely for surveillance or commodity.  We regularly receive unwanted cell calls from <a href="https://www.chatbot.com/help/train-your-chatbot/train-your-chatbot/" target="_blank">Chatbots</a>.  Google offers their <a href="https://cloud.google.com/natural-language" target="_blank">Natural Language</a> "Natural Language uses machine learning to reveal the structure and meaning of text. You can extract information about people, places, and events, and better understand social media sentiment and customer conversations." Of course, in implementing it, one is also enhancing Google's algorithms and their understanding and ultimately control of the internet.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, in the spirit of Eliza's Daughter as Janet Murray posits AI continues to be developed for creative/technical innovation and experimental storytelling.</p>

      <p>The Giver of Names is quite simply, a computer system that gives objects names. The installation includes an empty pedestal, a video camera, a computer system and a small video projection. The camera observes the top of the pedestal. The gallery visitor can choose an object or set of objects from those in the space, or anything they might have with them, and place them on the pedestal. When an object is placed on the pedestal, the computer grabs an image. It then performs many levels of image processing (outline analysis, division into separate objects or parts, colour analysis, texture analysis, etc.) These processes are visible on the life-size video projection above the pedestal. In the projection, the objects make the transition from real to imaged to increasingly abstracted as the system tries to make sense of them.</p>

      <p>An artificial neural network looks out onto the world, and tries to make sense of what it is seeing. But it can only see through the filter of what it already knows.  In this context, the term seeing, refers to both the low level perceptual and phenomenological experience of vision, as well as the higher level cognitive act of making meaning, and constructing what we consider to be truth. Our self affirming cognitive biases and prejudices, define what we see, and how we interact with each other as a result, fuelling our inability to see the world from each others’ point of view, driving social and political polarization.</p>

      <p>Virtually Asian is a short video essay that looks at how white science fiction filmmakers fill the backgrounds of their futuristic worlds with hollow Asian figures—in the form of video and holographic advertisements—while the main cast (if not the entirety of their fictional universe’s population) is devoid of actual Asian people.</p>

<p>With examples from major sci-fi productions spanning four decades, the video reveals this trope as a poor attempt to mask white supremacist imagination and casting. This well-trodden shortcut is meant to create the appearance of a diverse world without hiring non-white people in any significant capacity (in front of or behind the camera).</p>
