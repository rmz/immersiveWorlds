      <blockquote>Although the computer is often accused of fragmenting information and overwhelming us, I believe this view is a function of its current undomesticated state.  The more we cultivate it as a tool for serious inquiry, the more it will offer itself as both an analytical and a synthetic medium. - pg. 13
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>As these Utopian and dystopian fictions remind us, we rely on works of fiction, in any medium, to help us understand the world and what it means to be human. Eventually all successful storytelling technologies become “transparent”: we lose consciousness of the medium and see neither print nor film but only the power of the story itself. If digital art reaches the same level of expressiveness as these older media, we will no longer concern ourselves with how we are receiving the information. We will only think about what truth it has told us about our lives. - pg 32</blockquote>

      <blockquote>...the central thesis of the book, that computation offers a powerful new set of <strong>expressive affordances</strong> for the ancient human activity of storytelling...
        <br /><br />In short, a practice that was largely speculative when this book first appeared has now been validated by academia, artistic practice, and the marketplace. But it is still early days in expanding the expressivity of the medium for complex storytelling, and the future is still very much open for innovation.

      <h2>AFFORDANCES</h2>
      <p>Psychologist James J. Gibson (1904-1979) coined the word "affordance" to describe the "actionable possibilities" in an environment, in other words the environment providing the opportunity for action. Affordances depend upon the relationship between the environment and the human.
      </p>
      <p>It is through the environment affordances as perceived by people that we change the environment to suit our needs, such as creating stairs or winding paths upon the Earth's natural steep slopes so that humans may afford to walk up those slopes.</p>
      <p>Applied to digital production, affordances are an object’s properties that show the possible actions users can take with it, thereby suggesting how they may interact with that object.  Designers employ affordances from what users already understand. This appropriation can be done minimally by building upon established design patterns. A button doesn’t have to look like a real-world button with drop shadows and bevels. It only needs a cue to explain its interactivity.  Today an overlay upon a webpage may only have an X as the button to close the overlay.</p>

        11-episode animated video told through a series reports of Macy’s encounter with the epidemic, life during the quarantine, search for his grandfather’s farm and his revival. The video discusses the collapse of old community structures, the emergence of a new community after decollectivization, Confucian obedience vs. social obedience, as well as the new tele-republic of home, “mask politics” and social justice under the pandemic. Originally posted on TikTok to challenge the possibility of online exhibitions, the work is a response to this era of volatility, complexity and confusion.</p>
