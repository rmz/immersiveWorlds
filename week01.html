    <h1>XR Production for Media Makers: Introduction</h1>
  <p>Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications will be explored as tools for storytelling and visual creativity.</p>
  <p>Virtual Reality employs stereoscopic methods to present two offset images separately to the left and right eye of the viewer. These two-dimensional images are then combined in the brain to give the perception of 3D depth.  The use of stereoscopy to create the illusion of a 3D image from two 2D images dates back to the 19th century.
  </p>
  <blockquote>In 1838, Professor Sir Charles Wheatstone, of Wheatstone Bridge fame in electrical circuitry, published a scientific paper in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society (Volume 128, pages 371-394), describing how we see images in 3D. To support his ideas, he did some simple 3D drawings. In order to see the drawings in 3D, he invented, in the 1830s, the Wheatstone Stereoscope, an instrument still used today in radiography.<br />

  </blockquote>
  <p>
    With the popularization of photography by the mid-19th century, stereogram and stereoscopes became a popular mode of entertainment.  "Queen Victoria was said to be enthralled by stereoscopic photography; she saw her first 3D images at the Great Exhibition at Chrystal Palace in 1851." (<a href="http://www.stereoscopicsociety.org.uk/WordPress/early-3d/" target="_blank">Early 3D</a>).  A new industry, an offshoot of photography unfolded.

Computer generated VR has been around for some time.  The <i>Sword of Damocles</i>, a 1968 computer connected headmount created by  Ivan Sutherland and his student Bob Sproull used stereoscopy to present early computer renderings - wireframes of rooms.  This device is popularly considered the first VR experience. (<a href="https://www.vrs.org.uk/virtual-reality/history.html" target="_blank">History of VR</a>).  However, only recently have VR building tools and presentation devices become affordable and widely accessible.</p>

  <h1>XR Production for Media Makers: Introduction</h1>
  <p>Augmented Reality is much younger as AR apps require recent smart phones (although experiments that parallel AR have been executed prior to the smart phone).  Now both AR and VR are even available in modern browsers.  Now that we have these tools readily available and that there is increasing access by a mass population, the awe of VR and AR begins to diminish.  The tools and accessibility pins much greater importance on the quality and depth of content presented via these mediums.  So, through the semester, I would like you to ask yourselves:</p>
  <h2>How do you wish to employ these technologies as creative, experimental and/or exploratory/learning platforms?</h2>
  <h2>What are your goals in this course?</h2>

<p>You are most likely familiar with large scale AR applications such as Pokemon Go or the 2019 collaboration between Apple and the New Museum, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/07/apple-offers-new-augmented-reality-art-sessions/" target="_blank">[AR]T</a> for which several artists were commissioned to create a series of Augmented Reality experiences around Apple Stores worldwide.  <strong>In this class we'll be looking at small scale production and works created by independent artists, filmmakers and media makers utilizing both AR and VR for inspiration.</strong>  As well as content that isn't clearly defined between culture or art or entertainment or monetization...</p>

  Char Davies, <a href="http://www.immersence.com/" target="_blank"><i>Osmose</i></a>, 1995
  </p>
  <p>Immersion in Osmose begins with the donning of the head-mounted display and motion-tracking vest. The first virtual space encountered is a three-dimensional Cartesian Grid which functions as an orientation space. With the immersant's first breaths, the grid gives way to a clearing in a forest. There are a dozen world-spaces in Osmose, most based on metaphorical aspects of nature. These include Clearing, Forest, Tree, Leaf, Cloud, Pond, Subterranean Earth, and Abyss. There is also a substratum, Code, which contains much of the actual software used to create the work, and a superstratum, Text, a space consisting of quotes from the artist and excerpts of relevant texts on technology, the body and nature. Code and Text function as conceptual parentheses around the worlds within.</p>

  </p>
  <blockquote>Viewers are given an ipod and headphones and asked to follow the prerecorded video through the old train station in Kassel. The overlapping realities lead to a strange, perceptive confusion in the viewers brain. Hard to document and harder to explain. We only present the recorded audio here, but when doing the walk the real sounds mix with the recorded adding another level of confusion as to what is real and what is fiction. Wear headphones to get the full effect of the original binaural recording.</blockquote>

  </p>
  <blockquote>An augmented reality application that encourages participants to explore and experience local, ecological networks present in an urban park site. Cell phones and headphones are used to experience this artwork, which includes mixed-reality animations and storytelling as an overlay to the actual park. The experience is an embodied one, designed to connect humans empathetically with the biodiversity, symbioses, and unseen worlds in public park spaces.</blockquote>

      Eve Weinberg and Aaron Montoya-Moraga, <a href="https://anxiety.evejweinberg.com/" target="_blank"><i>Silence This Anxious Brain</i>, 2016</a>
    </p>
    <blockquote>Anxiety Brain is an online opportunity to step inside my mind, explore my anxious thoughts, and turn them off one by one. Technically speaking, it utilizes three.js (3D webGL), photogrammetry (a process to turn real world objects into 3D geometry), and spatialized sound. It was created by Eve Weinberg and Aarón Montoya-Moraga.</br>
The concept started from conversations Aaron and I have often about our own anxieties — both as artists and as humans. We often find humor in articulating the insanely specific thought that an anxious feeling can produce. We thought, what better way to showcase these thoughts than to musically arrange them as an endlessly looping a capella harmony. Then bury them spatially in the brain, encouraging people to find them (use headphones!) and turn them off one by one. We were hoping that the experience would be cathartic for the user, but also be entertaining and lighthearted.

      Sarah Rotherberg, <a href="https://sarahrothberg.com/MISMATCHED-TIME" target="_blank"><i>MISMATCHED TIME</i></a>, 2019
    </p>
    <blockquote>Mismatched Time is an interactive AR poem about space and time, that can be experienced anywhere.
Built as an experiment using the toolkit I co-created with Apple for their [AR]t Lab, Mismatched Time is an attempt to engage the participant in a series of choreographed movements: in order to advance the experience, the participant needs to move in proximity of certain objects: clocks, a snail, a moth, and then a sequence of arrows. The culminating moment of the experience, the arrows point to the world around the participant, so the experience takes on different meanings in different contexts.<br />
Each run through, the text of the poem is recombined in new ways: no two run-throughs produce the same results.

    Celine Lassus, <a href="https://celinelassus.com/PocketMom" target="_blank"><i>Pocket Mom</i></a>, 2020
  </p>
  <blockquote>PocketMom is a satirical virtual assistant made with SparkAR. The project documents advocating for yourself as a first generation college student. Coming to college, I felt an immense pressure to properly take advantage of this opportunity and knew I wasn’t alone. After talking to other first generation students about the relationship with their parents–how they tried to help or how they went about not knowing how to help–I pulled topics for each of the buttons surrounding the model. Although PocketMom attempts to mentor students through this vast and complicated world of academia, she becomes a sort of helicopter parent. As they say, the grass is always greener on the other side.

    Jacolby Satterwhite, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ta1b1uX36kg" target="_blank"><i>The 1975 - Having No Head</i></a>, 2020
  </p>
  <blockquote>Proceeding with my studio practice amidst a massive civil unrest and pandemic is a challenge that has reset my vision and intentions tremendously. After visiting and recording a few protests in Brooklyn, the only thing I could execute at a time like this is a reimagined safe space and a tribute to Breonna Taylor. This digital memorial can be seen in my video for The 1975’s song ‘Having No Head’. The short animation film is an alternative universe and recreational park where post-human Black femme bots have superior autonomy and immunity in a natural landscape. The other figures wearing gold hazmat suits are headless and lack immunity. Lately, I’ve shifted my interest to modelling recreational park landscapes in response to my research into Manet’s painting ‘Luncheon in the Grass’ (1862–63). The painting is considered the start of modernism and was controversial for depicting a female nude as the bourgeoisie and non-divine. Because 2020 is a major global paradigm shift, I feel like we are finally entering a new collective historical movement and theoretical shift as drastic as the dawn of early modernism. Therefore, digitally reimagining and reanimating ‘Luncheon In the Grass’ has become my main motif for pieces like ‘Having No Head’ and other projects I’m currently producing. A gesture that welcomes the new movement.

      Lauren Hutchinson with Tom Lofthouse, <a href="https://www.lahutchinson.com/pilgrim" target="_blank"><i>Pilgrim</i></a>, 2019
    </p>
    <blockquote>Making innovative use of augmented reality, Pilgrim is a phone application which lets you accompany a diverse group of walkers.<br />
Each year, more than 200,000 people make the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, Spain. Some do it only for recreation, but most have something personal to process. The communal hardship of the walk sets the conditions for a particular kind of openness between complete strangers. They listen to each other’s stories and put their own thoughts in order.<br />
 If you adjust to one walker’s tempo, you’ll hear him talk about a relationship breakdown. Another person is searching for a new goal in life. Other people are less willing to share their personal feelings. They just want to be part of the group—and the group isn’t talking continuously anyway. You’ll hear ambient noise and the occasional singing from a church service. Pilgrim is a journey with multiple meanings that can be traveled at various tempos.<br />
This is the world’s first augmented reality podcast.  It was created in partnership with BOSE AR as one of their very first mobile storytelling applications to demonstrate BOSE’s move into augmented reality.
